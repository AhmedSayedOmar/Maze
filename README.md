# Maze Generator and Solver

## Overview

This C++ project utilizes the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) to create mazes using randomized maze generation algorithms such as Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS), Kruskal's algorithm, and Prim's algorithm. Additionally, the project includes maze-solving algorithms like A*, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Users have the ability to play the generated mazes with varying difficulty levels.
